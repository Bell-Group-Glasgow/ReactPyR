# ReactPyR

ReactPyR was developed for use with Mettler's iCIR software via their proprietary OPC-UA software. Node addresses were obtained from Mettlers OPCUA software. 

This project was developed and tested using Windows 10 and on a ReactIR15 system and is written in Python3 using freeopcua (https://github.com/freeopcua).
